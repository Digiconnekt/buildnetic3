                <h4>What is SEO?</h4>
                <p>
                  If used properly, search engine optimization can be a powerful
                  tool for drawing customers to your online platforms. Keeping
                  up with the most recent changes in SEO can be difficult
                  because it is constantly changing. But the effort is
                  worthwhile: About 70% to 80% of users completely disregard
                  paid listings in favor of organic results. Furthermore, about
                  28% of those searches end in a purchase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to perform at the highest level in SEO, many metrics
                  must be taken into account, including traffic, backlinks, and
                  social media shares, to name a few. With the help of our
                  guide, you can gain knowledge about some of the most important
                  and timely search engine optimization trends to expect in 2022
                  and adjust your SEO strategy accordingly.

            <h4>Let’s dive into the trends.</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="fw-bold"
                    >Artificial Intelligence in SEO Will Be More Important
                    :</span
                  >
                  <br />
                  The way people interact with online content is changing as a
                  result of artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly
                  noteworthy is the AI algorithm used by Google. The RankBrain
                  algorithm, which was unveiled a few years ago, is a key
                  component of Google's ranking factors for search engine
                  results pages (SERPs) results. The other signals are all based
                  on discoveries and insights that people in information
                  retrieval have had, but there is no learning, said Greg
                  Corrado, a senior Google scientist who worked on the
                  development of RankBrain. This suggests that RankBrain will
                  continue to advance over time, making AI a key SEO trend to
                  follow. <br />
                  Determining how to optimize your SEO for RankBrain is
                  therefore a major concern. Although the dominant search engine
                  won't disclose specifics, experts concur that user experience
                  signals are the key factor. These might range from time spent
                  on the page to click-through rate. You must enthrall and keep
                  readers' attention with insightful, effectively organized
                  content. You can evaluate the strength of a page based on
                  factors like readability, backlinks, and more with the aid of
                  an on-page SEO checker.

                  >
                  <br />
                  Voice search technology has advanced significantly as a result
                  of innovations like Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, and
                  Amazon's Alexa. Technology has improved and grown in
                  popularity at the same time. In fact, 55% of households are
                  expected to have a smart speaker by 2022. <br />
                  Examine your keywords to optimize for voice search marketing.
                  Identify longer words that are frequently used in
                  conversation. Longer, more natural-sounding phrases typically
                  perform better in voice searches. People frequently use
                  abbreviations when typing. One might voice search "What are
                  the new SEO trends for 2022?" but type "new SEO trends 2022,"
                  for instance.

                  Google introduced mobile-first indexing in 2019, which refers
                  to the search engine focusing primarily on a website's mobile
                  version and treating it as the "primary" version rather than
                  the desktop version. Given that by 2025, nearly 73% of
                  internet users will only access the internet through mobile
                  devices, this change makes sense. Google offers a free
                  mobile-friendly test so you can see how effective your mobile
                  site is. <br />
                  Check out Google Search Console's "mobile usability" report
                  after that. Make sure you don't have a "disallow directive" in
                  place because you need to make sure Google can crawl your URLs
                  in order for your page to be user-friendly. Be aware that
                  content that requires user interactions, such as clicking or
                  swiping, won't be loaded by Googlebot.

                  The importance of content quality for successful ranking has
                  been emphasized by Google. What does "quality" actually mean
                  to Google, though? Consider the EAT principle: knowledge,
                  authority, and reliability. These elements aid in identifying
                  whether the content on a webpage is of high value. This idea
                  is particularly important in industries like health care and
                  finance which are considered to be "your money, your life"
                  (YMYL) businesses. <br />
                  A few methods exist for ensuring high-quality content. Create
                  buyer personas first, which will help you understand the types
                  of content that your clients find valuable. The consumer
                  journey can be mapped out using search intent research, which
                  is the second step. <br />
                  Third, make use of this knowledge to produce content that
                  adheres to the preferred format of your audience. For
                  instance, if you're targeting teenagers, video is probably
                  best. Video might not be as appealing to an older audience
                  you're trying to reach.

                  Long reads of 3,000 words or more receive four times as many
                  shares and three times as much traffic, according to our State
                  of Content Marketing Report. Additionally, they generate 3.5
                  times as many backlinks as articles with an average word count
                  of 901 to 1,200. Start putting more of an emphasis on
                  long-form content to rise up the search results. Thus, the
                  caliber of your content must be preserved. The objective is to
                  give users shareable content that keeps them interested.
                  <br />
                  How can you accomplish this? To make your content easier to
                  scan, first divide it into sections with H2 and H3
                  subheadings. Subheadings are crucial for mobile websites in
                  particular. Second, make sure that the sources you link to are
                  reliable, authoritative, and have a high authority score. Make
                  sure your content is simple to share, and finally. Include
                  clear sharing buttons in the headline and once more at the end
                  of the article so that readers can share with just one click.

                  Not to worry. If you want to move up the Google rankings, you
                  won't have to produce only long-term content. A kind of
                  shortcut to becoming well-known on Google, featured snippets
                  were introduced in 2017 and are very succinct. You might
                  occasionally see a box at the top of the SERPs, above the
                  actual results, when typing something into Google. A featured
                  snippet is a fantastic way to rank on the highly sought-after
                  first page of results. Additionally, snippets steal a
                  significant amount of traffic from rival websites. <br />
                  Featured snippets display a section of the text, frequently
                  organized as a Q&A or succinct how-to guide with bullet
                  points. Additionally, there are rich snippets that include
                  pictures, reviews with stars, prices, and other data. Focus on
                  question-based queries and pertinent keywords when creating
                  snippets. For ideas, use the "people also ask" search option
                  on Google.

                  In 2017, Google Discover went live, unleashing a brand-new
                  type of search that doesn't even require a user query. Another
                  AI-powered tool from Google is called Discover. Over time, the
                  content recommendation tool recognizes and gradually picks up
                  on user behavioral patterns. Discover can determine the most
                  accurate content that is most likely to pique the user's
                  interest using this information. <br />
                  There are currently more than 800 million active users of
                  Google Discover. You don't have to do anything special to
                  appear. Your page will be incorporated if Google indexes it.
                  Rankings of content are determined by algorithms that examine
                  user interest and content quality. Despite the fact that
                  Google has not disclosed any specific factors, it appears that
                  location history, browsing history, app usage, calendars, and
                  search history are involved.

                  The future seems to lie with online video. More than 1 billion
                  people use YouTube. The time is now to start producing video
                  content if you aren't already. Not persuaded? Here are some
                  ideas to consider: Cisco predicts that consumers will consume
                  more video than any other type of content. But how can you
                  optimize that video material? Make sure to optimize the name
                  and description of your video channel. Instead of stuffing the
                  description with keywords, try to give readers a clear idea of
                  what your channel is all about. <br />
                  In addition, keywords are very important. For instance, the
                  auto-complete function on YouTube can serve as an inspiration
                  if you're optimizing for that platform. Start typing the
                  subject of your video to see what appears in the search field.
                  This is essentially a list of suggested keywords that reveals
                  the most popular searches on YouTube.

                  <br />
                  Visual image search has significantly changed. People used to
                  be able to simply view images. People will soon be able to use
                  images to make purchases, get information, and more. Since
                  Google has long insisted that images be properly marked up and
                  optimized, it makes sense that this is a component of their
                  long-term strategy. <br />
                  If your website's images aren't optimized, fix it right away.
                  Use appropriate, high-quality images, and be sure to label the
                  photo file with a name that is specific to the information on
                  the corresponding page. Use alt tags to help crawlers
                  categorize your images.

                  Priority keywords were the sole focus of SEO experts in the
                  past. We now understand that secondary keywords are equally
                  crucial. Intent optimization and the semantic search will
                  become more important in the future. Google now considers more
                  than just word combinations. <br />
                  It examines the context of the search query and attempts to
                  determine the user's search intent, so the more pertinent
                  information offered through logically related primary and
                  secondary keywords, the better. To help you prioritize which
                  queries you want to target first, we provide a comprehensive
                  keyword tool that helps you find semantically related keywords

                  Create content that is intended to respond to queries put
                  forth by your target audience in order to effectively address
                  semantic search. Instead of concentrating only on keywords,
                  optimize your content for topic clusters. Use structured data
                  when it makes sense, to finish. Most importantly, write for

                  People frequently consider the internet's global reach when
                  they think of it. The majority of people do, in fact, use
                  search engines to locate nearby goods and services. For
                  instance, they might be looking for a nearby restaurant. Local
                  SEO is crucial and constantly changing. The increase in
                  zero-click searches, which some SEO marketers are referring to
                  as the "new normal," is partly to blame for this evolution. In
                  a zero-click search, the SERP itself responds to the user's
                  query. As a result, they choose not to click on any of the
                  ranking results. The increase in featured snippets is one
                  factor contributing to the rise in zero-click searches. <br />
                  Numerous zero-click searches are for local information, and
                  the results are displayed on the SERP in a section known as
                  the "local pack." How can you compete with the neighborhood's
                  other businesses? Make a Google My Business page first. A
                  solid backlink profile is also crucial. To get ideas, look at
                  the backlinks your rivals receive and focus on those yourself.

                  You can use data science to create targeted messages,

                  assist you in a number of ways, including confirming which
                  URLs are being crawled, identifying referral sources,
                  examining bounce rates, indexing, redirects, and more.
                  Additionally, you can use data science to locate unusual
                  traffic sources, such as potential spam sites, and identify
                  pages that you do not want crawlers to index (which will hurt
                  your EAT credibility). <br />
