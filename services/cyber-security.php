        <div class="border-black mx-auto mb-3"></div>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        The importance of security is growing as a result of the increased risk that businesses face from cyber security. Fundamentally, data leaks that could result in identity theft are now publicly published on various social media accounts because modern society has become more technologically dependent than ever and shows no signs of slowing down.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Additionally, because private information like social security numbers, bank account information, and credit card numbers are now stored in cloud storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, cybercriminals can more easily misuse them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        And the harsh truth is that everyone depends on computer networks on a daily basis, whether they are individuals, small businesses, or multinational corporations. The development of cloud services, insufficient cloud service protection, smartphones, and the Internet of Things all serve to aggravate it further.

              </li>
              <li>To stop threats from happening again, we pinpoint their underlying causes.

                  Modern operating systems, browsers, and software offer excellent protection against malware, viruses, and other online threats. When security flaws are discovered, companies release patches, which are compact pieces of software. Over 200,000 computers were impacted by the infamous ransomware attack known as WannaCry. It could have been avoided. Many computers didn't have the patch installed or updated, despite Microsoft having previously released a patch for the problem.
